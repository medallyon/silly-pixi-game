# Readme

This is a PIXI.js mini-game. This was a fun exercise!

## Requirements

- [x] Write your code in TypeScript and use pixi.js (v7) for rendering.
  - Right as I'm writing this, I realise I've used pixi.js (v8) throughout. Oops.
- [x] Each task should be accessed via an in-game menu.
  - There's a beautiful in-game radial card menu!
- [x] Render responsively for both mobile and desktop devices.
  - I made landscape a requirement for this game, which is reflected to the user.
- [x] Display the fps in the top left corner.
- [x] Run the application in full screen.
  - On Desktop, users can enter fullscreen mode with `F11`.
  - I attempted to make mobile devices full-screen when they're in the correct orientation, but the Fullscreen API is unreliable.

## Remarks

- Everything should be completely functional which I have tested on desktop and mobile. However,
- I'm not the best UI designer which is why the overall vibe of the game varies as I've used art and assets from random places around the web. I still hope it's pretty!
- There's a small bug with the radial card menu on the homescreen: when you hover in-and-out of cards very quickly, their position becomes lower and lower until they're eventually off-screen. Beware! (... or just reload the page if this happens to you.)
